    "I plan to take AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) in 11th grade to build my coding and problem-solving skills. I want to learn the basics of JavaScript and Python, as they are widely used in software development. Iâ€™m also considering majoring in Computer Science because I enjoy programming and problem-solving. In the future, I hope to gain hands-on experience through internships to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and explore different areas of the field."
