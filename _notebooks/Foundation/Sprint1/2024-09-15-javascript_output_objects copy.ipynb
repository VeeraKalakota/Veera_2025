This means when you run Sass code, you're actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser.\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",

    "    \"    \\\"- CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpages. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user.\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",

    "    \"    \\\"- **Nesting Capabilities**: SASS allows you to nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",
    "    \"    \\\"- **Modular Approach**: You can split your CSS into multiple files (partials) and import them into a main file, making your project more organized.\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",

    "    \"    \\\"### Maintainability\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",

    "    \"    \\\"### Advanced Features\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",
