# RPG Game Ideas:
- ### include levels, each level has an objective the player must complete, which will increase in difficulty as you progress into the game.
- ### incorporate sound effects for the player to have a more intense gaming experience
- ### should have multiple sprites, some for specific levels. For example, we can include a monster sprite that can chase the player through the maze.
