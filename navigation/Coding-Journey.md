# This is my journey in coding:


<br>


## Tools and Equipment Setup:


<br>


### Here are some links to use in setting up your laptop in VS code.    
- *https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/tools/setup: This will help you run the commands you need to set up your repositories, as well as opening VS code on your laptop. These instructions work for MacOS, Windows, or a Chromebook* 
- *https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/portfolio_2025, https://github.com/jm1021/john_2025: You can compare your repositories with these ones to see if you have anything missing, or you want to go to the next level with your hacks with innovative ideas.*


<br>


**Things to Keep in Mind**
**If you get corrupted (chromebook), and the teacher is busy with other students, use this command: rm -rf ________. The blank I provided is for the name of the repository that you want to delete. For example, if the name of your repository is "computer-science", then you would type in "rm -rf computer-science". This command allows you delete any repository, whether empty or full. Also, it will not ask you for any propmts.**
**If you want to go above and beyond with your work, you need to go to his office hours more often, and put more effort into this class.The more effort you put, when you show him for your hacks, he will boost your grade (0.9 --> 0.92).**
